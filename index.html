			<h1>The Best Hero's Journey Stories</h1>
			<p> The Hero's Journey is something we've loved seeing and enjoying throughout most of human history. We've followed heroes through moral and ethical undertakings against evil while they've taught us right from wrong through stories like Zeus, Aesops Fables, and today stories like the ones listed below. The journey is always the same, the hero's path a journey we expect to meet certain criteria, even if you didn't know the Hero's Journey Existed. </p>

				<h2>Lord of the Rings/Hobbit</h2>

					<p>The entire story of Middle Earth's journey towards the age of man is and will always be one of my favorite stories of all times. Tolkien created an entire world with clashing cultures, religions, and socio-economic caste systems. Framed as the untold adventures of Hobbits, Tolkien's work is a classic example of the Hero's Journey and speaks to our love for stories involving unlikely heroes tapped to do insurmountable tasks in the face of evil. Surely if Sam can carry Frodo up the mountain, we can make it through a pandemic.</p>

				<h2>Harry Potter</h2>

					<p> Harry Potter seemed like a good one to tackle next since Rowling took a lot of her "ideas" from the work of Tolkien (she didn't even try to hide her direct copying of his tropes and character types but I digress). Her stories also speak to our love of an unlikely hero facing set up him by outside forces. Much like in LOTR and other Hero's Journey stories, our "hero" was able to accomplish his task but only through the help of a special unsung friend who was able to rise to the challenge when our hero had fallen(Neville). While Rowling's personal TERF beliefs make this fandom hard to ethically navigate anymore, I cannot deny the beauty in them.</p>

				<h2>Star Wars</h2>

				<p>Star Wars will always be one of the best interpretations of the Hero's Journey because each episode (NOT 1-3, set those on fire) sends a beloved character on their own subplot-journey while Luke's whiney butt takes on the main hero's storyline. This gives us something to look forward to when we're over listening to yet another one of Luke's breakdowns. I also chose Star Wars because Joseph Campbell, the father of the Hero's Journey, once did a PBS special using his book "A Hero of a Thousand Faces" to interpret Star Wars episode 4-6 in collaboration with George Lucas. It's fascinating and a great way to learn about the topic.</p>

				<h2>Naruto</h2>

				<p>Naruto was the anime that made me fall in love with anime. I wasn't aware of the Hero's Journey when I started watching it, but quickly fell in love with the loud mouth ninja that everyone doubted would amount to anything. Naruto was placed upon the hardest Hero's Journey a person can face, the undertaking of battling our own demons and society's belief of our worth due to our past. This story, like the others, uses mentors and friends to help support our hero through his life long dream of becoming Hokage.</p>

				<h2>My Hero Academia</h2>
					<figure><img src="images/MHA.jpeg" alt="My Hero Academia Title Poster"></figure></figure></figure>
				<p>My Hero Academia comes in as a solid number two in the Hero's Journey Anime World (or the Shonen Jump category). The protagonist, Deku is born into a world of superheroes without a quirk (superpower), his innate courage and bravery make him the choice recipient of the world's greatest quirk. Like other hero's journeys, Deku must overcome a mighty evil while learning to control a superpower that could destroy him at any moment. Much like Naruto, Deku is battling his own inner demons while trying to prove himself worthy of his calling, but instead of fighting society's view of him, he's battling his own misbeliefs about his authenticity to deserve such power.
